# Used Cars Price Prediction

## Data Science with Python Certification Course

### Certification Project

#### Project Overview

This project is part of the Data Science with Python Certification Course and aims to apply the concepts learned throughout the course. You will build a predictive model to determine the selling price of used cars, helping the startup "MyCars" optimize their revenue in the competitive used car market.

#### Context

India's used car market is experiencing rapid growth, with an expected annual growth rate of 11% and projected sales of up to 8.3 million units by FY26. This growth is driven by several factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased digitalization, and changing consumer preferences. As a result, "MyCars," a startup in the car resale domain, is seeking to build a team of machine learning experts to develop predictive models for determining the prices of second-hand cars.

As a Data Scientist, your role is to create a robust model to accurately predict the selling price of a used car and identify the key features that influence its price.

#### Objective

- Develop a model to determine the price of used cars with high accuracy.
- Identify and analyze the most important features that influence car pricing.

### Data Description

The dataset provided contains the following columns:

- **Id**: Unique identifier assigned to each car.
- **Year**: Year the car was manufactured.
- **Brand**: Car brand.
- **Full Model Name**: Detailed model name, including engine capacity, transmission type, etc.
- **Model Name**: Model name of the car.
- **Price**: Selling price of the used car.
- **Distance Travelled (km)**: Distance covered by the car.
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used by the car's engine.
- **City**: City where the car is registered.
- **Car Age**: Age of the car.

### Steps and Tasks

1. **Import Libraries and Load the Dataset**  
   - Load necessary Python libraries and the provided dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Perform **Univariate Analysis** to understand the distribution of each feature.  
   - Conduct **Multivariate Analysis** to identify correlations between features.

3. **Model Development**  
   - Set up an experimental space for regression analysis to predict car prices.  
   - Evaluate and publish the performance of all models using a consistent hold-out/test dataset.  

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Identify the most influential features affecting the price of used cars.

### Conclusion

This project will enable you to apply your data science skills to a real-world scenario, creating a model that accurately predicts the price of used cars and identifies the key factors influencing these prices.
