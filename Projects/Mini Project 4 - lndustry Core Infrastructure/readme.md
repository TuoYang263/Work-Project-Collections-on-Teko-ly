# Industry Core Infrastructure Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Tableau-based dashboard for a British company to support decision-making related to sales forecasting and refund analysis. The company has experienced significant growth and aims to refine its approach to managing refunds and forecasting sales for the coming year.

## Business Scenario
The company's VP of Sales is dissatisfied with the traditional methods used for strategy development and seeks a data-driven approach. Tableau was selected as the BI tool of choice for this task due to its ability to meet the company's requirements.

## Objectives
- Forecast sales for the next year.
- Analyze and estimate the probability of refunds, categorized by different product types or regions.
