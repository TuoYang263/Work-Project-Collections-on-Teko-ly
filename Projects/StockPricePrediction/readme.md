# Stock Price Prediction
## _By Tuo Yang_

## Introductions
This project aims to utilize the LSTM network to perform stock price prediction, and the whole work can be split into two parts:
1. Making predictions to stock price using LSTM neural network
2. Building a dashboard using Plotly Dash for stock analysis


## The File Architecture of the Project

- **Datasets** - It contains two datasets: NSE-Tata-Global-Beverages-Limited.csv and stock_data.csv, both are for stock data analysis.

- **Model Files Saved** - The folder saves the model generated by the training process.

- **Program Running Results** - The folder saves the footage for displaying program running results.

- **stock_app_with_dashboard(plotly_dash).py** - The script that building the web pages used for displaying stock data analysis results.
- **stock_prediction.ipynb** - The script performs the initial stock data prediction by building and training the LSTM network.
