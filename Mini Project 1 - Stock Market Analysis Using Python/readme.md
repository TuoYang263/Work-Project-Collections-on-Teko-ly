# Stock Market Analysis Using Python

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Program and focuses on analyzing stock market data using Python. The objective is to gain insights into the performance of technology stocks like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft by using various data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to use Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to:

- Extract and analyze stock market data.
- Visualize trends and performance metrics.
- Evaluate the risk associated with different stocks based on their historical performance.

## Data Description

We will analyze the stock data of the following technology companies:

- **Apple**
- **Google**
- **Microsoft**
- **Amazon**

Initially, we will focus on Amazon's stock data individually and subsequently perform a combined analysis of all four companies.

## Data Source

The stock data will be retrieved directly from Yahoo Finance. You can explore more about the stocks and their data on [Yahoo Finance](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/).

## Tasks

The following tasks will be performed in this project:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Read stock data directly from the Yahoo Finance website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
3. **Price Analysis**: Determine the change in stock prices over time.
4. **Volume Analysis**: Visualize changes in the volume of stocks traded over time.
5. **Moving Average Calculation**: Compute the moving average for different stocks.
6. **Daily Return Analysis**: Calculate the daily return of each stock.
7. **Trend Analysis**: Create a new column called 'Trend' based on the daily return values.
8. **Trend Visualization**: Use a pie chart to visualize the frequency of different trends.
9. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between the daily returns of different stocks.

## Tools and Libraries

The following Python libraries will be utilized:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to provide meaningful insights into the performance and risks associated with the stocks of these major technology companies, leveraging data science techniques.
