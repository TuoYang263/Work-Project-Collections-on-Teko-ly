# üìÇ Data Projects Portfolio

Hi, I‚Äôm Tuo Yang ‚Äì passionate about turning data into actionable solutions.

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of practical data projects I've worked on, covering a range of domains and technologies‚Äîfrom data cleaning and analytics to machine learning and business intelligence.

These projects reflect my ability to work across the data pipeline: from collecting and transforming raw data to building predictive models and presenting insights clearly.

Whether you're hiring for a data analyst, data engineer, or machine learning-related role, I hope these examples demonstrate the breadth and depth of my technical and analytical skills.
